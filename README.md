## Features

- âš¡ <b>Lightning Fast</b> | Data from Realtime Trains is Fetched in a Matter of Seconds!

- ðŸ“‘ <b>Detailed JSON Response</b> | To get the Detailed Data instead of the Simple Data, you would have to contact the Realtime Trains Team. By using this package, you don't have to do that!

- ðŸ”“ <b>100% Free & Unlimited Access to Data</b> | By utilising [Node Fetch](https://npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) and [Cheerio](https://npmjs.com/package/cheerio), you can fetch data whenever and as many times as you want to, without any API Key!

## Install Package

To install the package, simply run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install realtime-trains-scraper`

## Example Code

```js
const realtimeTrains = require('realtime-trains-scraper');

// Fetching Data using the Station Code
realtimeTrains.getTrains("KGX");

// Fetching Data using the Station Name. However, this is not recommended as the Station Code is more reliable.
realtimeTrains.getTrains("London King's Cross");
```

You can also add a second parameter to specify how many results you want to get.

```js
realtimeTrains.getTrains("KGX", 10); // Defaults to 15 (Max).
```
